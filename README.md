## 🙋‍♂️ About me and what I do

 love working with fast-moving start-ups, scale-ups and tech enterprises. I aim to understand business problems and craft/deliver unique talent/sourcing strategies to solve them.

I've worked both as a 360 Recruiter and, have focused purely on sourcing and delivery. I use traditional and non-conventional recruitment approaches and technologies. I am an open-source advocate and continuously exploring open-source intelligence techniques and networking.

I'm tech fluent with a solid grasp on programming languages, infrastructure and product and can engage with and have meaningful conversations with technologists.

Outside of work, you will find me raising two hilarious little humans 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, attempting another DIY project 🔨 or with my head buried in talent/sourcing/cyber-sec blogs, community groups and tinkering with Python 🐍.

Hit me up if you wanna talk search and osint!
